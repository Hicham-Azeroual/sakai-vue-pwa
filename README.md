# Sakai Vue App

A modern, responsive dashboard application built with Vue.js and Vite, now enhanced as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for installable, offline-capable, and app-like experiences on desktop and mobile.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

Sakai Vue is a feature-rich dashboard template designed for rapid development of modern web applications. With the latest PWA enhancements, users can install the app on their devices and enjoy offline access, improved performance, and a native-like experience.

## üåü Features

-   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable, offline support, and app-like behavior
-   **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive design with PrimeVue components
-   **Dashboard Widgets:** Sales, notifications, revenue streams, and more
-   **Landing & Auth Pages:** Ready-to-use templates for common flows
-   **Customizable Layout:** Easily adapt to your branding and requirements

## üì± PWA Enablement

### What Was Done

1. **PWA Plugin Integration**
    - Integrated [`vite-plugin-pwa`](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) for automated service worker and manifest management.
2. **Web App Manifest**
    - Added `public/manifest.json` to describe the app (name, icons, theme, etc.).
3. **Service Worker**
    - Auto-generated by the plugin for offline support and caching.
4. **HTML Updates**
    - Updated `index.html` to reference the manifest and set the theme color.
5. **Icon Support**
    - Configured SVG icons for installability (add PNGs for broader compatibility).

### Benefits

-   **Installable:** Add to desktop or mobile home screen
-   **Offline Support:** Works without internet
-   **Native Experience:** Standalone window, custom icon, splash screen
-   **Performance:** Faster load times via caching

## ‚ùì Why Both manifest.json and vite.config.mjs Manifest Config?

### 1. `public/manifest.json`

-   A static file browsers use for installability during development and as a fallback.

### 2. Manifest in `vite.config.mjs` (via vite-plugin-pwa)

-   Lets the plugin generate a manifest dynamically during build, ensuring it is always in sync with the service worker and PWA features.
-   Recommended best practice: manage your manifest in the plugin config for production.

**What happens if both exist?**

-   In development, the static `public/manifest.json` is used.
-   In production, the plugin-generated manifest (from `vite.config.mjs`) is used and may overwrite the static one in the output.

| File/Config                | Used For                | When Used        | Who Uses It     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `public/manifest.json`     | Static manifest         | Dev & fallback   | Browser         |
| `vite.config.mjs` manifest | Dynamic, plugin-managed | Build/Production | Vite PWA plugin |

**Summary:**

-   The plugin config ensures your manifest and service worker are always compatible and up-to-date for production.
-   You can remove the static manifest if you rely solely on the plugin for production builds.
