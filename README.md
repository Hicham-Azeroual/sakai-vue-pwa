# Sakai Vue App

A modern, responsive dashboard application built with Vue.js and Vite, now enhanced as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for installable, offline-capable, and app-like experiences on desktop and mobile.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Sakai Vue is a feature-rich dashboard template designed for rapid development of modern web applications. With the latest PWA enhancements, users can install the app on their devices and enjoy offline access, improved performance, and a native-like experience.

## 🌟 Features

-   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable, offline support, and app-like behavior
-   **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive design with PrimeVue components
-   **Dashboard Widgets:** Sales, notifications, revenue streams, and more
-   **Landing & Auth Pages:** Ready-to-use templates for common flows
-   **Customizable Layout:** Easily adapt to your branding and requirements

## 📱 PWA Enablement

### What Was Done

1. **PWA Plugin Integration**
    - Integrated [`vite-plugin-pwa`](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) for automated service worker and manifest management.
2. **Web App Manifest**
    - Added `public/manifest.json` to describe the app (name, icons, theme, etc.).
3. **Service Worker**
    - Auto-generated by the plugin for offline support and caching.
4. **HTML Updates**
    - Updated `index.html` to reference the manifest and set the theme color.
5. **Icon Support**
    - Configured SVG icons for installability (add PNGs for broader compatibility).

### Benefits

-   **Installable:** Add to desktop or mobile home screen
-   **Offline Support:** Works without internet
-   **Native Experience:** Standalone window, custom icon, splash screen
-   **Performance:** Faster load times via caching
