# Sakai Vue App ‚Äì Progressive Web App (PWA) Conversion

---

## üìã Project Overview

Sakai Vue is a modern, responsive dashboard application built with Vue.js and Vite. This project has been **converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA)**, making it installable, offline-capable, and providing an app-like experience on desktop and mobile devices.

---

## üåê What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

A PWA is a web application that uses modern browser features to deliver a native app-like experience. Key benefits include:

-   **Installability:** Users can add the app to their home screen or desktop.
-   **Offline Support:** The app works without an internet connection.
-   **Native Experience:** Standalone window, custom icon, and splash screen.
-   **Performance:** Faster load times via caching.

---

## üöÄ What Was Delivered

-   The Sakai Vue app is now a fully functional PWA.
-   Users can install the app on desktop or mobile and use it offline.
-   The PWA setup is robust, using industry best practices and automated tooling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How PWA Works in This Project

### Service Worker Generation & Caching

The PWA functionality is powered by the [`vite-plugin-pwa`](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) plugin, which automates the creation and management of the service worker and manifest.

#### How the Service Worker is Generated

1. **Development:**
    - A basic service worker is provided for installability.
2. **Production Build:**
    - When you run `npm run build`, Vite outputs all static files.
    - The plugin scans the output, finds all files to cache, and generates a service worker with:
        - The list of files to cache (with hashed names)
        - Caching and update logic
    - The service worker is automatically registered in your app.

    D --> E[Service worker registered in app]
    E --> F[App works offline & updates automatically]
```

#### Why Not a Static Service Worker?

-   A static service worker in `public/` cannot track file changes or hashed filenames after each build.
-   The plugin ensures the service worker is always up-to-date and reliable.

## üìù Code Changes Explained

To enable PWA features, the following changes were made:

1. **PWA Dependency Installed**
    - Added `vite-plugin-pwa` as a dev dependency:
        ```bash
        npm install vite-plugin-pwa --save-dev
        ```
2. **Manifest Configuration**
    - Created `public/manifest.json` (for development and fallback):
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Sakai Vue App",
            "short_name": "Sakai",
            "description": "A modern Vue.js dashboard app.",
            "start_url": ".",
            "display": "standalone",
            "background_color": "#ffffff",
            "theme_color": "#0d6efd",
            "icons": [
                { "src": "/demo/images/logo.svg", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/svg+xml" },
                { "src": "/demo/images/logo.svg", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/svg+xml" }
            ]
        }
        ```
    - Also configured the manifest in `vite.config.mjs` for production builds (plugin-managed):
        ```js
        import { VitePWA } from 'vite-plugin-pwa';
        // ...
        plugins: [
            // ...
            VitePWA({
                registerType: 'autoUpdate',
                manifest: {
                    name: 'Sakai Vue App',
                    short_name: 'Sakai',
                    description: 'A modern Vue.js dashboard app.',
                    start_url: '.',
                    display: 'standalone',
                    background_color: '#ffffff',
                    theme_color: '#0d6efd',
                    icons: [
                        { src: '/demo/images/logo.svg', sizes: '192x192', type: 'image/svg+xml' },
                        { src: '/demo/images/logo.svg', sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/svg+xml' }
                    ]
                }
            })
        ];
        ```
3. **HTML Head Update**
    - Added manifest and theme color to `index.html`:
        ```html
        <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" /> <meta name="theme-color" content="#0d6efd" />
        ```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use and Test the PWA

1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. **Run in development:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
3. **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run preview
    ```
4. **Test PWA features:**
    - Open the app in Chrome, Edge, or another PWA-supporting browser.
    - Look for the install prompt in the address bar or browser menu.
    - Click to install the app to your desktop or mobile device.
    - The app will work offline after the first load.

## üì¶ Dependencies

-   [`vite-plugin-pwa`](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) ‚Äì Handles service worker and manifest generation for Vite projects.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure (Key Files)

```
src/                # Vue components, views, and layout
public/manifest.json # Web app manifest for PWA
public/demo/images/  # App icons and images
vite.config.mjs      # Vite configuration with PWA plugin
index.html           # HTML entry point
```

---

## ‚ùì Why Both manifest.json and vite.config.mjs Manifest Config?

-   `public/manifest.json` is used for development and as a fallback.
-   The manifest in `vite.config.mjs` is used by the plugin to generate a production-ready manifest and ensure it matches the service worker.
-   This approach guarantees your PWA is always up-to-date and reliable.

| File/Config                | Used For                | When Used        | Who Uses It     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `public/manifest.json`     | Static manifest         | Dev & fallback   | Browser         |
| `vite.config.mjs` manifest | Dynamic, plugin-managed | Build/Production | Vite PWA plugin |
